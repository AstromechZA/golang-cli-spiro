# `golang-cli-spiro`

This project template is designed to be used with [github.com/AstromechZA/spiro](https://github.com/AstromechZA/spiro).

It will generate a skeleton Golang cli project.

If you want a Golang package like `github.com/username/project`, make sure you
have a `github.com/username/` directory, then copy and modify spec.yaml and
run:

```
$ spiro golang-cli-spiro/{{.project_name}} spec.yaml github.com/username/
```
